• Showed bias;
• Was incompetent;
• Made inappropriate comments or questions;

• Displayed discourtesy;
• Unreasonably delayed matters.
Example: Karen complained to the Commission that Judge X pressured her to settle her court matter and give up her right to a hearing by making comments like: 'When you get in the witness box it's like open heart surgery. They cut you open – pull you open like some Portugese chicken and mess with your bits'.
Example: Benji was before the Court for a traffic offence. When he began to give evidence, the Magistrate took over and continually interrupted Beni's responses. At one stage the Magistrate said: 'Shut up, Mr. I'm going to talk to you now and you listen hard. That response you have earlier is another black mark against you. That was the most ridiculous thing to say'.
Example: The Magistrate continually rolled her eyes when Suraya was giving evidence at a trial.
