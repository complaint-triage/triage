Consumer matters are considered to be less serious in nature. They are OLSC as not involving issues of unsatisfactory professional conduct, and capable of being resolved complaints about the conduct of a solicitor, barrister or law firm that do. These complaints are assessed by the are.

Example: Charlie retained a solicitor to assist them in a local court matter. The solicitor was rude and dismissive of Charlie and they had to wait a long time for the advice.
Disciplinary matters

• failure to comply with an undertaking
• poor advice and representation
• serious delay

• breach of confidentiality.1
Example: Hudson goes to see a local solicitor to get some family law advice. He speaks to a solicitor and they exchange a few emails over the following weeks. He later receives a bill for a very large amount of money. This comes as a shock because the lawyer did not give him any information about how much they would charge.

Professional misconduct
Conduct by a lawyer in connection to the practice of law, that involves a substantial or consistent failure to meet or maintain a reasonable standard of competence and diligence.

• a tax offence; or
• an offence involving dishonesty.2

Example: Georgina is a barrister and a director of a company. She is convicted of stealing money from the company and is disqualified from acting as a director. This behaviour is likely to be professional misconduct.

Some complaints may involve both consumer and disciplinary matters.3 In these cases, the OLSC may give priority to resolving the consumer matter first.4
Costs disputes
There rules lawyers must obey when charging for their services. This includes telling clients what their legal costs are likely be, if they are going to me more than $750. You can complain to the OLSC if you have concerns about the costs you have been charged.
The OLSC will generally only deal with a costs dispute if: 
1. The total bill for legal costs is less than $185,460; or 
2. The total bill for legal costs equals or is more than $185,460 but the total amount in dispute is less than $18,550.5

If you have witness, know about, or have experienced this type of behavior, either as an employee or client of a legal services, you can lodge an informal complaint or a formal complaint with the OLSC.

Example: Taylor seeks is new a paralegal at a law firm. A senior lawyer at the firm keeps commenting on how much he likes the way she looks. Taylors has tried to laugh off his comments and but they are making her feel uncomfortable.
