Australian Federal Police & ACT Policing

In this fact sheet, we introduce the Australian Federal Police. We outline how complaints can be made by you as a member of the public or as an Australian Federal Police employee about Australian Federal Police appointees. The purpose of this fact sheet is to give general introductory information about the Australian Federal Police and the complaints process. It does not contain legal advice.
The Australian Federal Police (AFP) investigates crimes that fall within the law-making responsibilities of the Australian government (sometimes called ‘Commonwealth crimes’). ACT Policing (the community policing arm of the AFP) provides policing services in the Australian Capital Territory.

Sub-category
Example
Category 1 - Customer Service Issues
s 40RN Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth); Australian Federal Police Categories of Conduct Determination 2013
Category 1 complaints are at the lower end of the spectrum in terms of severity. These matters may be resolved within 5 days of receipt of the complaint, without being recorded in the AFP’s internal complaints recording and management system. 
Examples include, but are not limited to:
- Failure to provide a service or facility in an adequate, professional or appropriate manner.
- Failure to provide appropriate or correct advice.
- Unreasonable delay in dealing with an issue or providing a service.
- Failure to take appropriate action in relation to an issue where action by the AFP appointee was warranted in the circumstances.
- Discourteous behaviour including (but not limited to) rudeness, abruptness, verbal abuse, derisive attitude or behaviour, unreasonableness, lack of respect.
- Failure to comply with an AFP guideline, practice or procedure that resulted in a customer service issue of a minor nature.
This conduct might look like:
- Rudeness,
- Poor attitude and practice,
- Careless or poor service.
Category 2 – Misconduct and Unsatisfactory Behaviour
s 40RO Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth); Australian Federal Police Categories of Conduct Determination 2013
Category 2 complaints involve an AFP appointee engaging in: 
- Minor misconduct or inappropriate conduct (i.e. unsatisfactory behaviour), or
- Category 1 conduct which, due to its repeated nature, should be treated as Category 2 conduct.
Examples may include: 
Excessive use of force (where unlikely to amount to serious misconduct or serious negligence)
- Unauthorised discharge of a conducted energy weapon (e.g. a ‘taser’)
- Failure to apply sound security practices within their role and duties
- Breach of an AFP National Guideline or AFP Practical Guide where departure is inappropriate, unwarranted or unjustified and that does not amount to serious misconduct or serious neglect of duty
- Lack of proper attention/negligence 
- Breach of the AFP Code of Conduct, e.g.:
o Unwarranted attention towards a person who is not an AFP appointee, including harassment or taking action at a level that was unreasonable or unjustified.
o Failure to meet the standards of behaviour reasonably expected of an AFP appointee.
o Sexual harassment as defined in the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act 19841 where the victim wants the matter to be dealt with informally in the workplace and it is not going to be dealt with as criminal conduct.
o A breach of the AFP Code of Conduct other than those listed above.
Category 3 – Serious misconduct
Schedule to the Australian Federal Police Categories of Conduct Determination 2013
Category 3 complaints involve serious misconduct. A Category 3 complaint must meet at least one of the following criteria:
- The conduct as described in the complaint would, on the face of it, amount to serious misconduct or
- The conduct is assessed to have been carried out deliberately and/or is of such seriousness as to demonstrate that the AFP appointee has been wilfully or recklessly indifferent to the professional standards and integrity of the AFP, or
- The description of the conduct would reasonably lead to consideration of the employment suitability of the AFP appointee, or
- The conduct amounts to a criminal offence on its face. 
Noting that the below list is not exhaustive, examples include an AFP appointee engaging in:
Serious Breach of law
- E.g. Sexual harassment where the victim wants the matter dealt with formally and/or the behaviour is of such a serious nature (e.g. constitutes criminal conduct) as to require formal intervention.
Excessive use of force
- Unauthorised discharge of a firearm.
- Use of force where ‘non-approved methods or accoutrements are used’ to affect the force applied. 
- Any complaint made regarding excessive use of force where the subject sustains injury.

- Failure to secure ammunition and/or gun or other weapons, posing potential danger to the public or which may damage the reputation of the AFP.
Serious misconduct or serious neglect of duty
- Failure to report a contravention of Professional Standards by an AFP appointee.
Serious breach of the AFP Code of Conduct or National Guidelines
- Breach of the AFP Code of Conduct – multiple instances of conduct that could give rise to a Category 2 complaint.
- A serious breach of the Code of Conduct that involves serious misconduct or a serious neglect of duty
- A serious breach of an AFP National Guideline that involves serious misconduct or a serious neglect of duty
