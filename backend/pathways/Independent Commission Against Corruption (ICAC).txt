The Independent Commission Against Corruption

The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) acts to protect the public interest, prevent breaches of public trust and guide the conduct of officials in the NSW public service. It is an independent body set up under the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW) and has a central role in maintaining the integrity of the NSW public sector. 
The ICAC can receive and investigate complaints from anyone who suspects corruption involving the NSW public sector.  
The ICAC is a unique statutory body which resembles a court with special features. It has broad jurisdiction to investigate any allegation or circumstance which, in its opinion, implies that corrupt conduct has occurred. The ICAC receives and analyses complaints from members of the public and public officials, and reports made by the principal officers of public sector organisations.
Investigation is only one of the options open to the ICAC. Reports may also be referred to the relevant public authority for action, referred to other agencies if they are outside the ICAC's jurisdiction or used as the basis for corruption prevention work with the relevant public authority.

Public officials are individuals who work in the NSW public sector, have public official functions or actin a public official capacity, including:

The ICAC can investigate the conduct of public officials even when they are no longer employed in the NSW public sector. However, the conduct under investigation must have occurred whilst the person was a public official.
In some circumstances, private contractors and consultants can be considered to be public officials if they are exercising public official functions in NSW.

• Statutory bodies representing the Crown (for example, Legal Aid Commission of NSW or the NSW Land and Housing Corporation)
• Auditable entities (for example, public universities)

Exclusions

ICAC cannot deal with allegations of corruption in the private sector, unless NSW public officials and/or authorities are involved or affected.
