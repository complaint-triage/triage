Law Enforcement Conduct Commission

In this fact sheet, we introduce the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission (LECC). We outline how complaints can be made by the public and public authorities about the LECC. The purpose of this fact sheet is to give general introductory information about the LECC and the complaints process. It does not contain legal advice.
The LECC receives complaints about misconduct and administrative failures by NSW police officers, people who work for the NSW police force, and NSW Crime Commission personnel. The LECC may investigate complaints (and make recommendations for disciplinary action or prosecution) or refer complaints to other public bodies for investigation. The LECC is independent of the NSW Police Force. Its principal functions are to detect, investigate and prevent serious police misconduct.

serious disciplinary action against an officer or employee means terminating the employment, demoting or reducing the rank, classification or grade of the office or position held by the officer or employee or reducing the remuneration payable to the officer or employee. 
serious offence means a serious indictable offence and includes an offence committed elsewhere than in New South Wales that, if committed in New South Wales, would be a serious indictable offence.
