Discrimination in access to goods and services
You should not be refused access to good or services because of your disability. In some situations, people, businesses, public authorities, and other organisations are expected to make “reasonable adjustments” for people with a disability who are seeking goods and services.

You can make a complaint about  being treated unfairly on the basis of your racial or cultural background. You can also complain  if there is a rule or requirement that is the same for everyone but that adversely effects people of a particular racial group, and is not reasonable in the circumstances.
